# Detection-of-foreground-Objects

The project aims to detect and extract pixels of foreground objects from an image sequence or a video. Implemented algorithm works based on the chronology of image frames. The obtained pixels are dehazed using neighbourhood voting to ensure noise free foreground detection. ROC curve was plotted to the observe best Chebyshev inequality threshold (lambda) to be used for given image sequence.
